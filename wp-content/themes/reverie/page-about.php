              <p>Maggie is a northern Indiana fiber artist (ex-pat from Alaska), living on a small alpaca hobby farm in Elkhart County, and joined Reverie in 2014. She specializes in knitting, crocheting, spinning, and weaving lessons for all age groups. She teaches private or group lessons. She has also taught at the Michigan Fiber Festival in Allegan, MI, and at private retreats. Maggie creates continually, experimenting in traditional methods of knitted garment construction, and color work in Fair Isle, twined, entrelac, and intarsia. She enjoys working in a large variety of natural fibers. Maggie likes to
              design knitted and crocheted clothing, often seeing an item in 3-d in her brain, before it lands on paper or needles.</p>

              <p>Kelli’s partnership in the shop began with her interest in bringing some unique small gifts such as cards, soaps, tea towels, candles and vintage china to Goshen. She thought Goshen needed a wider selection of gifts that are locally sourced, handmade or recycled. Her interest in antiques/vintage seemed a perfect match with Rose Widmer’s expertise in quilts, linens, glass and china. As a partner with these other expert and gifted knitters, her interest in knitting has taken off and she now loves knitting, even as a novice. When her first grandchild was born, she knit her first baby sweater! Kelli states that "one of the huge side benefits of this partnership are the friendships that developed because of it. This is a group of wildly talented and fun group of women I wouldn’t know otherwise!</p>
